### 1. Install the ´AngularCLI gh-pages´:
Use the following commands on your Terminal:
 ```
npm i angular-cli-ghpages
ng add angular-cli-ghpages
 ```
 ### 2. Deploy the project:
 Use the `ng deploy --base-href=/PROJECT_NAME/` command. Keep the `/` in. If you don't know the name of your project, look into the `tsconfig.json` file of your project. In our case, it will be

 ```
ng deploy --base-href=/BioHackathon-Web/
 ```

 ### 3. Go to the url:
 Usually, URL's in Gihub pages follow this model: `https://USER_NAME.github.io/PROJECT_NAME/`. In our case, the URL is:
 - [https://miguelpadillar.github.io/BioHackathon-Web/](https://miguelpadillar.github.io/BioHackathon-Web/)
